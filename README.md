# Bill learning how to Kalman Filter

This repo is going to contain various learning projects that involve simple Kalman Filters (if there's such a thing as a simple Kalman Filter).

## Projects overview:
- Python KF simulation
  - Model a simple diff-drive with random measurement noise
  - Learning points:
    - KF implementation (theory)
    - Python (general)
    - Python modeling and simulation (Numpy, MatPlotLib, ModSimPy, etc)
- Non-ROS Arduino KF for simple remote diff-drive car from scratch
  - Learning points:
    - KF implementation (practice)
    - Arduino sensor input (IMU/GPS)
- ROS Arduino KF
  - Learning points:
    - ROS

## Python simulation:
### Progress:
- Basic graphing and data generation
- Filter 1D static model

### Next:
- Filter 1D first order model(Constant speed)
- Filter 1D second order model (Constant accel)
- State space representation of 2D static, 1st, and 2nd order models
- Filter...
